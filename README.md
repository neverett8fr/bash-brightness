# bash-brightness
Simple bash script to change the brightness of attached displays  
`./adjust-brightness`  
```
./adjust-brightness
The connected displays are: HDMI-0 eDP-1-1 please choose one
HDMI-0
Chosen connector:  HDMI-0
Choose brightness: 
0.4
Display: HDMI-0 will be set to 0.4
```
In the future I'd like to add this to gnome / have a gui (and actually affect the backlight), but this'll do for me, for now.
